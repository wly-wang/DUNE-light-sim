This one's a bit ugly, sorry.

You need to copy the fit constants from the log output of the fitter into the src/main.cpp file in the appropriate place, and then probably tinker with some other things.

This is a very manual process, I didn't attempt to automate it. Once you've edited the code then run.sh should do everything else.
